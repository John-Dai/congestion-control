running on John's local VM:
relayer's bandwith is 3389.376000 kb/s

our protocols:
slow start in the beginning (increase window by 1 per ACK received)
use RTO equation to calculate timeout length
if any packet in sender buffer times out-->resend that packet and go into transition state
in transition state, dont real any more input, just wait for sender buffer to empty (resend until they are all acked)
once complete go into AIMD (halve window, increase window by 1 per RTT)
continue to check for timeout and go into transition state as needed

obserations: we get an average throughput of 5mb/s
window size peaks at a bit over 100 in slow start, and in aimd oscillates from about 15 to 40
